### https://comp-org-etext.netlify.app/CS131/#how-to-use-this-textbook
- “Transistors to Assembly” book stops at assembly or C? Either way is fine. Just double checking. **stops at assembly**
- “Sidebar Menu” has two sentences with no period at the end. **fixed**
- Genera: Should “topic” be lowercase? **Fixed**
### https://comp-org-etext.netlify.app/CS131/#introduction
- Should “Section” be lowercase? **Fixed**
- Capitalization in this whole section is strange. **Fixed per previous suggestions**
- Do we really need the legal “number (number)” scheme? **yes, going to keep that style for now**
### https://comp-org-etext.netlify.app/CS131/#history
- Should it be “throughout the ages”? **fixed**
- Need lowercase “abstraction” and “algorithms” **fixed**
- Section incomplete? Is the “quick question” completable with the given information? **removed question and details**
### https://comp-org-etext.netlify.app/CS131/#foundations
- Foundations section doesn’t get highlighted when scrolling to it **side-effect of the rendering tool and being at the bottom of the page**
- Should be “computing technology” instead of “computer technology”? **fixed**
- Replace “Next we will need to brush up on our knowledge of” with “Next we will examine” **fixed**
- Replace “Finally, we will dive down to the lowest levels of computer hardware, transistors.” with “Finally, we will dive down to the lowest levels of computer hardware: transistors.” **fixed**
- “We'll” -- avoid contractions in formal writing? Should be “we will”? **fixed**
- Remove the word “those”: “We'll understand how these simple devices create circuits to perform those numeric and logical operations” **fixed**
- Sentence starts strangely. “How those circuits are used to store information, route data, and ultimately create a microarchitecture that can execute complex programs” Should it be combined with previous sentence? **fixed**
### https://comp-org-etext.netlify.app/CS131/#assembly-programming
- The word “finally” is used here but it is also used in the previous section **fixed**
- Replace “we will use a simple assembly language and development environment to create and run programs.” with “we will use a simple assembly language and a development environment to create and run programs.” **fixed**
- Don’t use idioms like “behind the scenes” **fixed**
- Java is not simple. Remove this word. **fixed**
- “Like Java” should be “such as Java” **fixed**

### https://comp-org-etext.netlify.app/CS131/CourseInformation.html#course-information-2
- California should be CA not Ca  **fixed**
- Department is called “Mathematical Sciences Department” **fixed**
- Put a label on “Introduction to computer architecture and assembly language programming”. What is this? **fixed**
### https://comp-org-etext.netlify.app/CS131/CourseInformation.html#using-these-materials
- Section not needed? It’s covered at the beginning **fixed**
### https://comp-org-etext.netlify.app/CS131/CourseRational.html#student-learning-outcomes
- Replace “In this course, students will peer into the lowest levels of a general-purpose computer” with “In this course, students will peer into the lowest levels of a general-purpose computing” **fixed**
- “Facebook, the Mars Rover, and a Tesla all have the same basic low-level structure, organization, and tradeoffs” confusing to students. Also missing period. **removed**
- “Allan Hancock” should be “Allan Hancock College” **fixed**
- Are SLOs and Objectives required in this book? Do students care about these? **removed...and no, students do not care much about them**
