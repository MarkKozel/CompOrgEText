# Computer Organization E-Textbook
## Online Open Educational Resources (OER) / Zero Cost Textbook (ZCT)

## Project
Create a set of online resources to replace current textbook for CS 131, Computer Organization at Allan Hancock

Use [VitePress](https://https://vitepress.dev/) Vue-based static site generator, [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) interactive element to create an online, interactive, and searchable set of resources for college students pursuing a degree in Computer Science

Additionally, this project will be structures to make integration into other college Computer Science programs simpler and flexible

**Proposal**
## CS 131 Course Info:
Basics of computer Number Systems, Logic Operations, Computer Electronics from transistors to CPUs

Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) and Assembly Language Programming using the Little Computer 3 (LC-3) ISA emulator run on Windows PCs

Current Textbook: Patt & Patel. introduction to computing systems: from bits & gates to C & beyond. Second Edition. McGraw-Hill. ISBN-hardback: 978-0-07-246750-5 2003

Purchase: $150 (new) $112 (used). Rental $97 (new) $60 (used)

The current course structure is tied closely to the organization of the textbook. The textbook is organized such that students do not get to program in assembly language until the 6th week of class. The first 5 weeks are building foundational info, but no connection to programming until later. I feel using programming throughout the course would help reinforce the fundamentals with hands-on programming opportunities
