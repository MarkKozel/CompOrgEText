**The von Neumann Model**
Define the elements John von Neumann designed in the 1940 that still exist in today's computer hardware. We will understand the elements our assembly instructions will interact with to execute programs.

**Commands**

Breakdown of assembly instructs used in the LC-3 environment. Includes examples and walk-troughs.

**Basic I/O**

Discover how computer hardware communicate with the outside work, and how the LC-3 interacts with the keyboard and display I/O devices.

**Program Flow**

Develop a working understanding of how basic program flow, like If/Else is created in assembly and the LC-3, in particular.

**Development**
Tools and practices from creating, document, and modifying source code
