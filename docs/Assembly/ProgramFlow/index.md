### Terms Used in this Section
!!!include(TextSnippets/Assembly/ProgramFlow_Terms.md)!!!

## Sequential Program Flow
This is normal program execution. Each instruction in order.

## Conditional Program Flow
Programs can decide, while executing, to jump to a different section of the programs. If/Else is a common conditional flow example.

## Iterative Program Flow
Based on some value, a program make execute the same set of instruction several times, until something changes. This is seen in loop flows like for-loop and while-loop behavior.
