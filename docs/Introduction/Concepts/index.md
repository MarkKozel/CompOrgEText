## Abstraction
A key element to learning and communicating elements in the physical world is our ability to create abstraction layers, that is: defining different levels of detail about an element to be used in different contexts.

In this unit, we will discuss abstraction in general terms, and, introduce the Abstraction Hierarchy of Computer Organization.

## Algorithms

Our daily life is filled with step-by-step procedures we follow to efficiently and effectively complete tasks. From logging in to your college course to calculating the expected trajectory of an orbiting satellite, algorithms keep order and consistency in many things we do.

In this unit, we'll use algorithms as a device to discuss and understand what is going on at each Computer Organization Abstraction Layer.

## Connecting Hardware and Software
Software developers typically focus on organizational systems and programming languages to solve problems. Computer engineers focus on hardware, peripherals, and networks to solve problems.

Computer Organization connects those two worlds, and explores how they work together to provide today's modern computer systems.

In this unit, we will review the interface between hardware and software.

## Analog and Digital Computers

Analog computers, from a simple stick with notches, to a room-sized vacuum tube computer rely on analog values to represent information.

With the advent of transistors, analog voltage could be used to represent discrete digital values. Combined with a new standard (von Neumann architecture) and well-known number system (binary), digital computers became a standard.


## Specific and General Purpose Computers

Computers designed to solve problems. Simple problems lead to simple computers that solved a specific problem. It was reasonable to create and use a computer that solved a single problem.

As computers evolved to solve more problems, and more complex problems, computer scientists in the early 1940s realized the need to create general computer standard. This general architecture contained all the parts needed to solve many problems using different programs and I/O devices.
