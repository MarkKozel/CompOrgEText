The current makeup of computer and mathematics jobs among these diverse groups are:
- 25% women
- 8% African Americans 
- 7.5% Hispanic or Latino people

As you may have noticed, the history of modern computer science is dominated by male scientists and mathematicians primarily from western countries. While this was likely driven by social norms and educational barriers from the mid 20th century, there are purposeful efforts to changes those norms, and to encourage gender, ethnicity, and class diversity in technology fields.
