**Microprocessors**

The Intel 4004: the first commercial microprocessor consisted of 2,300 transistors

The next major advance in fundamental computer technology was the
**microprocessor**. These devices are integrated circuits that combine
thousands of transistors that perform the logic needed to run a computer
into one chip. In 1971, Intel released the 4004 microprocessor and the
**Fourth Generation** of computers had begun.

In the late 1970\'s computers like the Altair, Apple and Commodore were
the first computers widely sold to individual users. In 1981 IBM
released the first PC and the personal computer revolution had begun.
Although the machines we use are millions of times more powerful than
those early personal computers they are direct descendants of these
machines.

The Apple I computer was sold as a kit for which people had to build
their own case
