Devices have been used to aid computation for thousands of years. The
earliest known counting devices are clay tokens that were in use before
4000 BC. A given token might represent one sheep or ten sheep. To
represent a count of 32 sheep, you would take three 10-sheep tokens and
two 1-sheep tokens and seal them in a clay container.

Counting stones

By about 2500 BC, counting devices had been abstracted away from
counting a particular thing and abacuses first appeared in Sumeria.
These devices rely on the user moving beads or stones to represent
numbers and to do arithmetic on them. Since then, many other forms of
reckoning boards or tables have been invented. In a medieval European
counting house, a checkered cloth would be placed on a table, and
markers moved around on it according to certain rules, as an aid to
calculating sums of money.

**The Antikythera Mechanism**

The ancient Greeks used complex devices to compute the timing of
astrological events Antikythera mechanism and the astrolabe from ancient
Greece. The **Antikythera mechanism** was a clockwork device of
complexity that would not be seen again until the 14th century.

In the 1600s, the first mechanical calculators were developed. A
teenager named Blaise Pascal (later to become a famous mathematician)
was one of their inventors. Pascal began to work on his calculator in
1642 when he was only 19 years old. He had been assisting his father,
who worked as a tax commissioner and sought to produce a device that
could reduce his workload. The device he built, called the **Pascaline**
could do addition and subtraction including automatically carrying from
one place to the next. Many other mathematicians of the 17th century
tried their hand at building their own calculators, including [Gottfried
Leibniz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Leibniz) who described a
machine that would be implemented using
`binary numbers <binary>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
