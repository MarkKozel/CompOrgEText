Today we live in a world dominated by computers. We are surrounded not
only by the desktop and laptop computers that are a feature of nearly
every office and home, and the smartphones that are seen as a standard
modern accessory, but also by the computational devices embedded into
nearly every electrical device we touch. Microprocessors are built into
cars, watches, televisions, coffee makers and countless other devices.
Although there is no widespread agreement on the topic, some people have
declared this world of **ubiquitous computing** (computers found
everywhere) the Fifth Generation of computing because of the fundamental
change in how we interact with computers.

Modern microprocessors like this Intel i7 processor feature billions of
transistors on one chip the size of a fingernail.

Smartphones like the iPhone are more powerful computers than the
supercomputers of the 1970s. And they can play Angry Birds.

How these fantastically complex microprocessors are manufactured:

*Chip Manufacturing - How are Microchips made? - Infineon Technologies AG*
<p>How are microchips made - from sand to semiconductor: Microelectronics usually is hidden to society â€“ however, it is a constant companion in our daily lives. It tremendously contributes to the ongoing development and digitization of our world. But what is actually behind this technology?

In this video we explain how microchips are made and what conditions are necessary for manufacturing.</p>
