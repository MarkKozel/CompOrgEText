**Integrated Circuit**

Integrated circuits combine multiple transistors into one compact
package.
:::

Jack Kilby of Texas Instruments invented the **integrated circuit** in
1958. Integrated circuits (ICs) combine many transistors into a single
package; compared to individual transistors, they consume less power and
can be packed in much tighter. Early ICs consisted of only a handful of
transistors, but now days integrated circuits can be made with billions
of transistors in the space of a fingernail.

Third Generation
:::

The ability to pack more computational power into less space heralded a
new generation of computers. Computers of the **Third Generation**,
built with integrated circuits, were even smaller more powerful and
cheaper than the Second Generation. Instead of building all the logic
for a computer in terms of individual transistors, integrated circuits
allowed designers to work with more abstract logical building blocks. A
new class of computer, the minicomputer, was created. Though still large
by today\'s standards, minicomputers were significantly less expensive
than the large mainframe computers previously available and brought
computers into even more businesses.

This generation also saw the introduction of many features we now take
for granted. Keyboards and displays were developed during this period to
facilitate real-time interaction with computers - prior machines had to
be fed a job and left to run it with little in the way of feedback
provided until the job was complete.
`Operating systems <operatingsystems>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
were developed that allowed multiple programs and users to interact with
the machine at once.

The PDP machines of the third generation were enormously influential -
much early computer science was done on these machines
