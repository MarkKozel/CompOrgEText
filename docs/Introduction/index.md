## Introduction

## Abstraction
A key element to learning and communicating elements in the physical world is our ability to create abstraction layers. That is, defining different levels of detail about an element to be used in different contexts.

In this unit we will discuss Abstraction in general and introduce the Abstraction Hierarchy of Computer Organization.

## Algorithms

Our daily life is filled with step-by-step procedures we follow to efficient and effective complete tasks. From logging in to your college course Canvas site to calculating the expected trajectory of an orbiting satellite, algorithms keep order and consistency in many things we do.

In this unit, we will understand Algorithms as a device to discuss and understand what is going on at each level at each Computer Organization Abstraction Layer.

## Connecting Hardware and Software
Software developers typically focus on software and programming languages to solve problems. Computer engineers focus on hardware, peripherals, and networks to solve problems.

Computer Organization connects those two (2) worlds, and explores how they work together to provide today's modern computer systems.

In this unit we will review the interface between Hardware and Software.
