# Course Rationale
In this course, students will peer into the lowest levels of a general-purpose computer. Facebook, the Mars Rover, and a Tesla all have the same basic low-level structure, organization, and tradeoffs.

This course will cover what computers consist of, how computers work, how they are organized internally, what are the design tradeoffs, and how design affects programming and applications.

## Student Learning Outcomes
Allan Hancock has identified the expected outcomes for students completing CS 131/COMP 142
