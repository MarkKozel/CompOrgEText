## Introduction
This text is divided into the following sections:

1. [Introduction](../Introduction/index.md)
1. [Foundations](../Foundations/index.md)
1. [Assembly](../Assembly/index.md)

Each section contains topics. For example, the Introduction section contains the following topics: Diversity, History, and Concepts.

Each topic contains one or more topic units. For example, the History topic contains the following topic units: Prehistory, Dawn of Computers, 1st Generation Computers, 2nd Generation Computers, 3rd Generation Computers, 4th Generation Computers, and Modern Computers.

## History

We'll learn about:
- The progress of computer technology through the ages
- The core concepts of abstraction and algorithms as used in computer organization
- The differences between analog and digital computer systems
- How specific-use computers gave way to the general-use computer in use today

## Foundations

To start, we will build a foundation of computer organization with the pioneers that, across the 20th century, created today's computer technology.

Next, we'll need to brush up on our knowledge of the basic numeric and logical constructs that drive modern computer systems.

Finally, we will dive down to the lowest levels of computer hardware: transistors. We'll understand:
1. How transistors create circuits to perform numeric and logical operations. 
2. How circuits are used to store information, route data, and ultimately create a microarchitecture that can execute complex programs.

## Assembly

In this part of the class, we'll use a basic assembly language and development environment to create and run programs.

Using assembly, we'll see the basic constructs of high-level programming languages (like Java), for example: *If-Else*, *For* and *While* loops, calling *Subroutines*, and interacting with *Input*/*Output* devices.
