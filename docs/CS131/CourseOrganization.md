## Introduction
This course is divided into three (3) sections:

1. [Introduction](../Introduction/index.md)
2. [Foundations](../Foundations/index.md)
1. [Assembly Programming](../Assembly/index.md)


## History

We'll learn a bit about the progress of computer technology through the ages. 

Understand the core concepts of Abstraction and Algorithms as used in computer organization.

Clarify the differences between Analog and Digital computer systems, and how Specific-Use computers gave way to the General-Use computer we use today.

## Foundations

To start, we will build a foundation of computer organization with the pioneers that, across the 20th century, created today's computer technology.

Next we will need to brush up on our knowledge of the basic numeric and logical constructs that drive modern computer systems.

Finally, we will dive down to the lowest levels of computer hardware, transistors. We'll understand how these simple devices create circuits to perform those numeric and logical operations. How those circuits are used to store information, route data, and ultimately create a microarchitecture that can execute complex programs.

## Assembly Programming

Finally, we will use a simple assembly language and development environment to create and run programs.

Using assembly, we will see behind the scenes of simple high-level programming languages (like Java) constructs like *If-Else*, *For* and *While* loops. Calling *Subroutines*, and interacting with *Input*/*Output* devices.
