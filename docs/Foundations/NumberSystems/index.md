## Introduction

The advent and evolution of number systems were essential to keep pace with human's needs for understanding and classifying the work around us. Creating a common system to show and calculate quantities is the framework or mathematics...and, more specific to our interests, computer science.

In this section, we will review our understanding of the Base 10/Decimal number system as you likely learned in early elementary school.

We will see how a different number system, built on the same rules and constructs learned in primary grades, is best suited for modern computer systems.

And we will learn of a couple of other systems that make it easier for computer scientists to discuss numbers in software and hardware.

## First a Review

*A brief history of numerical systems - Alessandra King - TED-Ed*
<p>1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9... and 0. With just these ten symbols, we can write any rational number imaginable. But why these particular symbols? Why ten of them? And why do we arrange them the way we do? Alessandra King gives a brief history of numerical systems.</p> <p>Lesson by Alessandra King, animation by Zedem Media.

## Decimal Values
Let's start by reviewing some key concepts of the Base 10/Decimal system. Decimal is so engrained in our society, economy, and scientific practices that it is easy to forget the underlying rules that govern it.


## Binary Values
The same concepts from the Decimal Number System can be applied to other systems. We will see how, with a basic change to the *Base-iness* of the system, we can define a different system.


Apply base 10 principles and practices to base 2.

## Hexadecimal Values
Understand how base 16 (hex) number system is a shorthand to base 2 (binary).

## Representing Numbers in Binary
Discover how binary is applied to modern computer hardware/software to represent base 10 numeric information.

Including Unsigned and Signed Integers, and Fractional numbers.

## Representing Non-Numeric Data in Binary
Learn how binary is encoded in various formats to represent text and other non-numeric data.
