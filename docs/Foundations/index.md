## Pioneers
While computers have been evolving since the humans developed numbers and counting in fingers, modern computers have their roots in 20th century.

Even before the technology existed to build a digital computer, scientists were developing the theories and designs that would eventual create the modern computer. Among these scientists are a few key people that layed the foundation upon which today's technology-rich world is built.

## Number Systems
Review the common Base 10 (decimal) number system, then build up out understanding of how Base 2 (binary) numbers are used in computer organization.

## Logic and Digital Circuits
Put binary data to use to design and build complex hardware elements to support modern computer hardware functions.
