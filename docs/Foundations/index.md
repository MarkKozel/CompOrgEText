**Pioneers**

While computers have been evolving since humans developed numbers and counting on fingers, modern computers have their roots in the 20th century.

Even before the technology existed to build a digital computer, scientists were developing the theories and designs that would eventual lead to the creation of the modern computer. Among these scientists are a few key people that layed the foundation upon which today's technology-rich world is built.

**Number Systems**

Review the common Base 10 (decimal) number system, then build up an understanding of how Base 2 (binary) numbers are used in computer organization.

**Logic and Digital Circuits**

Put binary data to use to design and build complex hardware elements to support modern computer hardware functions.
