## Introduction

Claude Shannon (1916 - 2001) was an American mathematician, electrical engineer, and considered the father of Information theory.

As part of his master's thesis in 1937, Shannon defined a new branch of mathematics, *Boolean Algebra*. In his work, he layed out the basis od digital circuit design and the use of binary numbers as the basis of digital hardware.

## Key Elements of Binary

Technology was primarily analog-driven at the start of the 20th century. With electricity, voltage was used to represent *information*. 
- A voltage above a certain level, say 10v, would be considered a *high* or *on* indication
- A voltage of zero (0) represents *low* or *off*

Because voltage exists in an infinite number of levels, it is an analog signal. In the above example, what value would 0.3v or 8.7v mean?

When voltage transitions from *low* to *high* it is not a smooth line on a graph

Claude Shannon recognized four (4) advantages of the binary number system that led to it's adoption into modern digital computers

### Simple

At its heart, binary values are simple. A binary digit being either a **1** or **0** is just about as simple as a number base can be. Because digital circuits were 

### Unambiguous



### Flawless copies
