Hardware is obtained, software is written, and the team integrates all of the items to verifies it all works</p> <p>While the high-level description of this phase is pretty simple, this is where much of the effort occurs.

It is also essential that testing is not defined at the end.

A large company will also have subject-matter experts (SMEs) that only do certain tasks, such as Database Design, User Interfaces, Testing. SME's will have specific steps to guide the, through their part of the process</p> <p>Students in a Computer Science course can scale these same projects to be simpler for a group project.

Parts must be able to run on their own to satisfy some part of the whole problem</p> <p>Parts are implemented and tested. Testing of parts can be more rigorous because parts are simpler that a larger program.</p> <p>Finally, the 'main' program is created and calls the parts (such as Java functions) in the right order and with the right data to solve the problem</p> <p><strong>Advantages</strong>
Defining a program as a set of parts or functions allows for multiple programmers to work on different parts at the same time
With one part defined as function, it can be tested with various data to ensure it handles different situations
Once thoroughly tested, a part can be considered complete
Because each parts solves some part of the problem, that part can be used in other programs to solve similar problems</p> <p><strong>Disadvantages</strong></p> <ul><li>Parts can be created and tested, but do the wrong thing. This won't be discovered until the final integration</li> <li>With multiple programmers working on a project, moe time must be spend ensure everyone understands what each of their parts are expected to do</li></ul> <blockquote><p>A purely Top-Down or Bottom-Up approach is unlikely to be a good approach in the real world. A mix of both, driven by the project complexity, is a common approach</p></blockquote> <h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion" class="header-anchor">#</a> Conclusion</h2> <p>Software Engineering is the methodical practice of creating a program</p> <p>Steps of Software Engineering can be scaled up or down to fit the complexity of the project</p> <p>Top-Down and Bottom-Up design approaches are two different ways to create software.
