|Term|Meaning|
|:-:|:-|
|**Truth Table**|A tablature representation of all if a circuit's inputs and outputs|
|**Transistors**|Electronic devices used to represent binary *1* or *0* in hardware|
|**Circuit**|Group of transistors that implement logic, control, or storage capability in hardware. AKA *Gate*|
|**Logic Function/Circuit**|Operation that processed input signals into a boolean output. i.e. *AND*, *OR*, *NOT* |
|**Arithmetic Function/Circuit**|Operation that processed input signals into a mathematical output. i.e. *ADD*, *SUBTRACT* |
|**Storage Function/Circuit**|Operation that retains input signal (single bit)  between clock cycle. i.e. *STORE*, *RETRIEVE* |
|**Input/Output**|Electrical or binary signals sent into or received out of a transistor, circuit, or arithmetic function |
|**P-Type Transistor**|Transistor that outputs the opposite reference/boolean value than its input|
|**N-Type Transistor**|Transistor that outputs the same reference/boolean value as its input|
|**Invert/Inversion**|Switching a value/state to its opposite reference value/state. i.e. binary *1* is inverted into a binary *0*|
|**Ripple circuit**|A set of identical circuits *chained* together to cause an output from one circuit feeds the next circuit, and affects the next circuit's result. Common in arithmetic circuits that require *carry/borrow* interactions between values |
