|     **Asynchronous**     | A data exchange between sender and receiver when they do not share an internal clock. **- See Notes for more on how to better this definition and Synchronous definition.**                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|    **Data Register**     | A storage location that a central processing unit (CPU) and Input/Output (I/O) Device use to exchange data. Data registers are used in *Polling* and *Asynchronous* data exchange.                                                                                                           |
|       **Driver**         | A type of software that negotiates data transfer between an I/O device and a CPU.                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Input/Output Device**  | A hardware component installed on a motherboard that facilitates passing of data between that device and the CPU. Inputs and outputs are from the perspective of the CPU. A keyboard is a CPU *input* device and a monitor is a CPU *output* device. 
|
|      **Interrupt**       | Controlling data exchange by requiring the I/O device to notify the CPU there is new data, then waiting until the CPU to request the new data when it is ready to process it.                                                          
|
|       **Polling**        | Controlling data exchange by checking for new data in a repetitious time interval.                                                                                                                                                     |
|      **Priorities**      | A system the CPU uses to *decide* which I/O data to process next if there are multiple devices with data ready to process.                                                                                                                        |
|   **Status Register**    | A storage location that CPU and I/O Device use to share the I/O Device's status. Status registers are used in *Polling* and *Asynchronous* data exchange.                                                                                                     
|
|     **Synchronous**      | A data exchange between sender and receiver when they share an internal clock. **- See Notes for more on how to better this definition and Asynchronous definition.**                                                                                                                                                                                   |
