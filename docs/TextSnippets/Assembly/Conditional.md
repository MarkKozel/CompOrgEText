Conditional and Iterative constructs use a condition to *decide* to change program flow. The condition is set prior to the conditional or iterative code. It may be set by data from previous instructions, user inputs, or data form other programs or computers.

The **Condition** is the result of comparing data with another data items, or to a range of values. The condition typically a *Boolean* result of a true/false.

::: details Example Comparisons
- data is the same as a single value  ```x = 17```
- data is larger that a value         ```x > 16```
- data within a range of values       ```x > 16 && x < 87```

In each case, the comparison is either true or false

With the Condition evaluated, the program will execute or skip certain code if the condition is ```true```. Otherwise, the program will continue executing in a sequential flow
