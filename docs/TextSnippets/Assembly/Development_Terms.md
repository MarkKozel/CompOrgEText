|  **Bottom-Up Design**   | A design process that starts by creating and testing each part of the algorithm's functions, then creating the *main* function to use the parts.                                                                       |
|      **Comments**       | Text explaining the meaning of lines or section of source code so that people other than the coder can understand what the code does.                                                                                                                          |
|      **Debugging**      | A development tool and/or practice used by a software developer to find and fix errors in a program. There are many tools and practices available to choose from depending on the situation.                                                                                                                    |
|       **Design**        | A process used to plan and implement a program's source code.                                                                                                                                                         |
|  **Functional Error**   | A program error caused using the wrong function or data. The program may run to completion or stop with *run-time* error.                                                                                            
| **Program Flow Error**  | A program error caused by missing instructions or instruction executed in the wrong order. The program runs to completion, but produces the wrong output or result.                                                      ||
|  **Syntactic Error**    | a program error caused by misspelling an instruction or failing to use a function correctly. The compiler/assembler fails to build the program or execute it.                                                          |
|   **Top-Down Design**   | A design process that starts by creating and testing the *main* section of the program to ensure it executes an algorithm in the correct order, then the details of each part of the algorithm are created and tested. |
|     **Whitespace**      | Indents and blank lines in source code used to make code more readable for humans.                                                                                                                                |
