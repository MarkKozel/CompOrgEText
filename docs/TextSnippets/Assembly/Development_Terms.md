|  **Bottom-Up Design**   | Design process that starts by creating and testing each part of the algorithm's functions. Then creating the *main* function to use the parts                                                                       |
|      **Comments**       | Text explaining lines or section of source code used to make it understandable for humans.                                                                                                                          |
|      **Debugging**      | Development tools and practices used by software developers to find and fix errors in a program.                                                                                                                    |
|       **Design**        | Process used to plan and implement a program's source code.                                                                                                                                                         |
|  **Functional Errors**  | Program errors caused using the wrong function or data. The program may run to completion or stop with *run-time* error.                                                                                            |
|  **Syntactic Errors**   | Program errors caused by mis-spelling an instruction or failing to use a function correctly. The compiler/assembler fails to build the program of execute.                                                          |
| **Program Flow Errors** | Program errors caused by missing instructions or instruction executed in the wrong order. The program run to completion, but produces the wrong output/result.                                                      |
|   **Top-Down Design**   | Design process that starts by creating and testing the *main* section of the program to ensure it execute an algorithm in the correct order. Then the details of each part of the algorithm are created and tested. |
|     **Whitespace**      | Indenting and blank lines in source code used to make code more readable for humans.                                                                                                                                |
