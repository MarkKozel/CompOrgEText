|         **ALU**         | The arithmetic and logic unit (ALU) is a component in the CPU that preforms mathematic and logical functions.                                                                                         |
|      **Branching**      | A technique that causes a program to change the flow of its execution; e.g., *if/else* and *calling a function*.                                                                                                  |
|     **Clock Cycle**     | A single time segment, controlled by the computer's clock, in which circuits receive input values, process the inputs, and then produce an output.                                                |
| **Condition Code (CC)** | Information about the previous instruction's result.  Can indicate that the previous instruction resulted in an *error/exception*, *overflow/underflow*, or *positive/zero/negative* value |
|      **FDE Cycle**      | The *Fetch-Decode-Execute* pattern used by the CPU to execute a single instruction.                                                                                                         |
|     **Instruction**     | Single executable line of code in a program. Contains OpCode and Operands.                                                                                                                  |
|         **ISA**         | *Instruction Set Architecture*. LIst of all *Instruction* OpCode and expected Operands.                                                                                                     |
|       **Memory**        | Storage used by the *program* to save and retrieve data. This storage is external to the CPU.                                                                                              |
|       **OpCode**        | Assembly instruction keyword as defined by the *ISA*.                                                                                                                                       |
|     **Operand(s)**      | Assembly instruction parameters, as defined by the *ISA*.                                                                                                                                   |
|      **Register**       | Storage used by the *CPU* to save and retrieve data. These devices directly connected to the CPU's control device and the ALU.                                                             |
|     **Subroutines**     | Subset of *branching* that has added capabilities like *passing parameters*, *throwing exceptions*, and *returning results*.                                                                |
|    **TRAP Routines**    | Functions that are built-in to the programming language; e.g., *System.out.println()* in Java.                                                                                                |
