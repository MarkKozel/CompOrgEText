Logic is the basic decision-making language for computer hardware and software. Using the simplified binary number system, computers function in the mutually exclusive realm or *and*/*or*/*not*

While this is a very simple realm, it allows computers to complete tasks very fast. This speed then allows computers to complete more tasks for a given time unit that a device that functions in an environment of base 10

Transistors are the lowest level computer hardware element. When supplied with a voltage, a transistor can represent a single binary value. The two standard transistor types (P-Type and N-Type) can be arraigned to function as simple logic circuits

Circuits are the engine that powers logic operation in computers. Each elementary logic construct can be made physical with an equally elementary circuit. These circuits are built from configurations or 4 or 6 transistors

More complex logic constructs can be realized in configurations of elementary circuits

Finally, arraigning circuits in different configurations yields control and storage devices. These elements function as Memory, Controllers, Registers, and Arithmetic Logic Units (ALU)...combined to make the modern Central Processing Unit (CPU) at the heart of modern computers
