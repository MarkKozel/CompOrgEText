The Foundation of Computer Organization is build if along and rich history of need, creation, and refinement

Technology, in the context of Computer Organization, is physical devices to solve a problems. A primary forces in advancing this technology are accuracy and speed...create or improve a thing so that does something better. Better would typically be less error-prone, and/or faster

In this section we will:

- review the technological events and advancements that got us here

- understand the Binary Number System and how it is used in modern computer

- discover the logic that uses Binary, and how the simple transistor implements that logic

- recognize the scientists that led the evolution of today's modern computer
