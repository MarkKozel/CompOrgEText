#### Transistors to Assembly - A Bottom-Up View of Computer Science

The Foundation of Computer Organization is build on a long and rich history of need, creation, and refinement.

Technology, in the context of Computer Organization, is physical devices to solve a problems. A primary force in advancing this technology are accuracy and speed...create or improve a thing so that does something better. Better would typically be less error-prone, and/or faster.

In this text, we will present computers from transistors at the bottom; though circuits, logic, and binary numbers; up to assembly language programming.
