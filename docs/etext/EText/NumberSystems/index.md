The advent and evolution of number systems were essential to keep pace with human's needs for understanding and classifying the work around us. Creating a common system to show and calculate quantities is the framework or mathematics...and, more specific to our interests, computer science

In this section, we will review our understanding of the Base 10/Decimal number system as likely you learned in early elementary school

We will see how a different number system, built on the same rules and constructs you learned in primary grades, is best suited for modern computer systems

And we will learn of a couple of other systems that make it easier for computer scientists to discuss numbers in software and hardware

And why do we arrange them the way we do? Alessandra King gives a brief history of numerical systems.</p> <p>Lesson by Alessandra King, animation by Zedem Media.

## Decimal Values

Let's start by reviewing some key concepts of the Base 10/Decimal system. Decimal is so engrained in our society, economy, and scientific practices that it is easy to forget the underlying rules that govern it

[Decimal Values](./DecimalValues)


## Binary Values
The same concepts from the Decimal Number System can be applied to other systems. We will see how, with a basic change to the *Base-iness* of the system, we can define a different system

[Binary Values](./BinaryValues)

Apply base 10 principles and practices to base 2

## Hexadecimal Values
[Hexadecimal Values](./HexadecimalValues)

Understand how base 16 (hex) number system is a shorthand to base 2 (binary)

## [Representing Numbers in Binary](LINK TO SECTION)
Discover how binary is applied to modern computer hardware/software to represent base 10 numeric information

Including Unsigned and Signed Integers, and Fractional numbers

## [Representing Non-Numbers in Binary](LINK TO SECTION)
Learn how binary is encoded in various formats to represent text and other non-numeric data
