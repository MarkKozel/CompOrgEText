## Introduction

The Little Computer 3 (LC-3) assembly environment is an emulated Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) used to learn the basics of assembly language programming

The ISA is limited to 20+ actual instructions, but contains enough capability to learn and experiment with assembly programming

LC-3 is a simulated Von Neumann computer Instruction Set Architecture (ISA). Its purpose is solely for teaching Assembly programming and underlining control micro architecture

The LC-3 editor and simulator are used in the course to use the defined ISA to create programs that preform standard Input-Processing-Output flow implemented in the lowest-level human-readable language, Assembly

### Downloading the Tools
In class, we will be using version 3.01. Linux and Windows versions should be downloaded from McGraw Hill (https://highered.mheducation.com/sites/0072467509/student_view0/lc-3_simulator.html)
There are various implementations of the LC-3 available online, but most are student projects or hobby programmer implementations. Using these version may change your results

### Installation
Both Tools and supporting files are not installed in the typical Windows installation process. The downloaded .exe for Windows is an auto-unzip files that will copy files to the chosen directory.
Uninstalling  only required deleting the directory contains the “installation”
