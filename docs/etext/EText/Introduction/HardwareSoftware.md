## Introduction

Computer Science courses focus primarily on software (File Systems, Operating Systems, Network Protocols, Bits and Bytes). Computer Engineering courses focus primarily on hardware (Processors, Storage, Data Buses, Voltage and Current)

Computer Organization connects those to worlds, and explores how they work together to provide today's modern computer systems

To look discuss the interface between Hardware and Software, we need to dive down into the lowest levels of the Computer Abstraction Layers. We will learn how a 5-volt current becomes a bit of data, Why the timing of hardware is essential of digital data integrity, and How a set of electronic circuits can reliably manipulate bits into useful data
