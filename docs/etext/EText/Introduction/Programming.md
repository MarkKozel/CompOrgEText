## Introduction

As a CS student, you have already programmed in a high-level language, like Java. In that process you have taken a problem and solved it with a program. In doing so, you have likely encountered an error in your program, and had to change your code to make it work

In computer organization, you will work in a low-level programming language to solve similar problems. In the process, you will learn ways to plan out your program to minimize errors. And, since errors are still likely to occur, you will learn tools and methods to debug your code

While you will be working in a low-level language, the planning and debugging practices can be applied to higher-level languages, using Abstraction
