## Introduction
Humans, by default, understand the world through classifying and grouping information about the world in which we live. Associating items based on similarities and differences helps us communicate our understandings of our world. It could be argued that this capability of humans is something that sets us apart from other animals

## Why Use Abstraction
A key element to learning and communicating elements in the physical world is our ability to create abstraction layers. That is, defining different levels of detail about an element to be used in different contexts

::: details Abstraction Example
If you were describing email to a person, if would be helpful to know their understanding of things like the Internet, computers, web browsers, office memos, etc

For someone with a hands-on understanding of these concepts, such as a fellow CS student, you would use terms like *Ethernet, WiFi, Authentication Credentials, Service Provider, Spam* without additional explanation

For someone that uses email, but is not technically trained, you would use words like *Internet Connection, Account Login, GMail, Unwanted emails*, likely without needing and additional explanation

And, to describe email to someone that does not use a computer regularly, you will use terms like *Computer's Connection to other computers, Sign-in information, Company that provides E-Mail service*

Abstraction works in layers, each having more details and specific meaning
