Labels in assembly source code are the method of denoting a particular location in the program that may be branched to from some other location in the program. Labels are human-readable test, named to help the programmer understand what the label is used for. During the assembly progress, the LC-3 Edit will convert labels to a PCOffset values needed for the BR instruction.
